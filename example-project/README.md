# Example IG project with tests

1. Make sure JDK (>= 1.8) and nodejs are installed.
2. Run `npm install` in a terminal to download the required .jar files.
3. Run `npm test` in a terminal or in vscode by clicking `Terminal -> Run Task -> npm test`.

If you want intellisense in test-specification yaml files: Open vscode and install the recommended *redhat.vscode-yaml* extension.
